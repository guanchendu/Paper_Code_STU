## Overview
GASN introduces a **dual-attention framework** that integrates a multi-layer graph attention mechanism with a self-attention–based interaction module to enhance blockchain service reliability prediction.  
The model effectively captures both **local structural dependencies** among users and peers and **global contextual correlations** in sparse blockchain environments.
